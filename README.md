# React Open Guided Project

## Overview
Welcome to Project Mode in React! This week, you'll be working with a partner to build a full-stack project using React and a Rails API.

This README will serve as your guidelines for building your project. You will have about a week to complete this project, and you will check in with your instructors midway to review completion of your project's MVP. 

Work with your partner to design a project - you may want to use a wireframing tool like [Moqups](https://moqups.com/) and a drawing tool like [Draw IO](https://www.draw.io/) for planning your frontend's looks and backend's domain. When you have a plan put together, please obtain approval from your instructors before proceeding to code. You will be expected to discuss what you plan to have finished as an MVP and what you plan for the fully completed version of your project. The earlier you get approval, the earlier you can start!

And remember: you are still learning React! Be conscious of your own learning goals while also taking into account the learning goals of your partner. Use this opportunity to share knowledge and fill-in each other's gaps, and make sure to use only **1 machine** at a time, switching driver and navigator at pre-determined intervals.

## Minimum Deliverables
- Sort / filter functionality
- At least 3 database models (max 5)
- At least 2 forms
- Full CRUD on at least one model
- 3 distinct views (e.g. 'index' page for listing, 'show' page for detials)
- Reuse of at least one component in multiple pages in your application

### MVP
Your instructors will specify a date to check in with them. You will show them a partially working application with minimal to no styling that has at least the bare-minumum functionality. For instance, if you are making Bookface, a Facebook clone, you should come in able to render a user's posts, create a new post, and like a post. You may not have all of your minumum deliverables met by this point, but you should have the semblance of a working project

### Final
Not much to be said - have a fully functioning project that meets the above minimum deliverables. Your instructors may schedule a final check-in to review what you've done and give you feedback on your progress either the day of project presentations.

## Tech guidelines

### APIs
As this project is focused on React and full-stack web design, you will be building your own API to serve data to your React frontend - please review lecture videos and notes on setting up a Rails API. **Do not** use outside APIs - use this project as an opportunity to fine tune your React and Rails skills!

### React Router
React Router is a great tool for giving multi-page functionality to your React Single Page Application but comes with some overhead. Use at your own discretion - remember that you can fake multi-page functionality using simple conditional rendering, you just won't have URLs to specific pages.

### Styling
Unless you are experienced with CSS, please refrain from trying to write your own custom CSS. [Semantic UI](https://react.semantic-ui.com/) and [Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/) both have great React libraries and extensive documentation. Avoid using Material UI unless you are familiar with it, as it has much more of a learning curve.
